            <p class="mt-3">Skiing allows one to truly enjoy the outdoors during the winter season by 
                escaping to the mountains. But first, one needs the proper equipment such as boots, poles,
                and of course, skis. These can be rented or purchased at most ski resorts or other establishments
                offering these products. Once purchased, head on up to the mountains.</p>

            <p class="mt-3">Skiing is a perfect combination of exercise and enjoyment. Once the basic techniques are learned, the whole resort is yours to 
                explore. Where you ski is up to you. Resorts come with a variety of terrain, views and snow quality. With Utah having the best snow on earth 
                (except for year 2025), each resort will provide a thrilling and adventerous experience.</p>
